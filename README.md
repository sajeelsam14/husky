# Node.js Project with Husky, Prettier, and ESLint

This project demonstrates the integration of **Husky**, **Prettier**, and **ESLint** in a Node.js application. 

- **Husky** is used to set up pre-commit hooks.
- **ESLint** ensures the code adheres to linting rules.
- **Prettier** automatically formats the code for consistency.

The goal of this setup is to maintain high code quality and consistency by automating linting and formatting checks before each commit.
